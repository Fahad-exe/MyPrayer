# MyPrayer
MyPrayer application is an Android app that every Muslim needs, the idea of the app is to have all the functions that Muslim use such as finding the direction of the Kabaa to know where to pray, knowing when the five prayer times are and having an audio player that gives the user the ability to listen to Quran. In addition to that, the aim of this project was to create an application that would be fitting to the entire target market of Muslim society such as Muslim kids, Adults and newcomers to Islam.
